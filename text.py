        The Gini coefficient is used to measure inequalities of any distribution.
        It ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 represents perfect equality (everyone has the same income - in the current conext)
        and 1 represents maximum inequality (one person has all the income, and everyone else has none).<br><br>
        This analysis compares the Gini coefficients before and after taxes for selected countries,
        highlighting the impact of taxation on income distribution.
        The top plot shows the Gini trends for the selected countries,
        the middle plot illustrates the gap between each country's Gini and the global median,
        and the bottom plot displays the global median Gini over time.<br><br>
        Income is equivalized - a statistical technique in income statistics,
        adjusting household income by household size and composition to make incomes comparable across different households.<br>
